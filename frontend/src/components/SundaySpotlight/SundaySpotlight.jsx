        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mt-2 italic">
          ‚ÄúBeing part DMC has been one of the most impactful experiences I‚Äôve had
          at VCU. From the very beginning, DMC gave me a strong sense of
          community, a space where I could connect with other men of color who
          understood the challenges and opportunities that come with navigating
          college. The mentorship and support I‚Äôve received through DMC have
          helped me grow both personally and professionally.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mt-2 italic">
          What I appreciate most is how DMC balances brotherhood with
          development. Whether it‚Äôs workshops on career preparation, service
          projects that give back to the community, or even just building bonds
          through the different activities, DMC has pushed me to step out of my
          comfort zone and keep improving myself. It‚Äôs not just about having a
          network it‚Äôs about having a community that challenges you, uplifts you,
          and holds you accountable.‚Äù
